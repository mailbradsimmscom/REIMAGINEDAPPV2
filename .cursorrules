# STRICT RULES - NEVER VIOLATE

## NEVER DO:
- DELETE working code
- Remove existing functionality  
- Access database outside /repositories folder
- Use console.log in production code
- Hardcode API keys or URLs
- Create test-*.js files in root
- Modify .env or secrets
- Access process.env directly (use centralized env.js instead)

## ALWAYS DO:
- Use repository pattern for ALL database access
- Keep database logic in /repositories only
- Use environment variables from centralized env.js configuration
- Preserve existing functionality
- Follow existing code patterns
- Test changes before committing
- Make active additions to the admin logging dashboard to log and visual new functionality properly

## ARCHITECTURE:
- /repositories - ONLY place for database queries
- /services - Business logic only
- /routes - HTTP endpoints only
- Never mix these layers

# MODULE REQUIREMENTS

## STRICT ESM MODE:
- Use ONLY ES modules (import/export)
- NEVER use require() or module.exports
- Type: "module" must be in package.json
- File extensions: .js with ESM syntax
- Import must include .js extension: import x from './file.js'

## NO MONOLITHIC FILES:
- Max 260 lines per file
- One class or service per file
- Split large functions into smaller helpers
- Separate concerns into different files
- If a file does 2+ things, split it

## FILE STRUCTURE:
- Each route in separate file
- Each repository in separate file  
- Each service in separate file
- Utils broken into small modules
- One exported function/class per file

## NODE 20 FEATURES:
- Use native fetch() not axios
- Use native crypto not bcrypt
- Use native test runner not jest
- Use top-level await
